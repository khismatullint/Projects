    <h2>SmartCalc v1.0</h2>
    <p>The program developed in C language of C11 standard using gcc compiler with additional QT
        libraries and modules</p>
    <p>The program code located in the src folder</p>
    <p>The program build with Makefile which contains standard set of targets for GNU-programs: all, install,
        uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, test, gcov_report. Installation directory could be arbitrary, except the building
        one</p>
    <p>The program developed according to the principles of structured programming</p>
    <p>The code accorded the Google style</p>
    <p>There are full coverage of modules related to calculating expressions with unit-tests using the Check library</p>
    <p>GUI implementation, based on Qt</p>
    <p>Both integers and real numbers with a dot can be input into the program</p>
    <p>The calculation are performed after you complete entering the calculating expression and press the `=` symbol.
    </p>
    <p>Calculating arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation</p>
    <p>Calculate arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation with substitution of the value of the
        variable _x_ as a number</p>
    <p>Plotting a graph of a function given by an expression in infix notation with the variable _x_ (with coordinate
        axes, mark of the used scale and an adaptive grid)</p>
    <p>Domain and codomain of a function are limited numbers from -1000000 to 1000000</p>
    <p>To plot a graph of a function it is necessary to additionally specify the displayed domain and codomain</p>
    <p>Verifiable accuracy of the fractional part is at least to 7 decimal places</p>
    <p>Users must be able to enter up to 255 characters</p>
    <p>Bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation must support the following arithmetic operations and</p>
    mathematical functions:</p>
